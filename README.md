Using the CloudFlare API via Python
Very early on in the company’s history we decided that everything that CloudFlare does on behalf of its customer-base should be controllable via an API. In fact, when you login to the CloudFlare control panel, you’re really just making API calls to our backend services. Over time that API has matured and improved. We are now on v4 of that API.

The current CloudFlare API is documented here and it’s used by both the CloudFlare control panel and directly by umpteen customers every minute of every day. The new API is designed with a clean naming structure and consistent data representation for data. It’s also extensible.

This blog entry introduces python-cloudflare, a Python wrapper providing full access to the CloudFlare v4 API.
